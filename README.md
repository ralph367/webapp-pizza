## Pizza Web app

For this task, I'm going to use Django to build the web application. Eventhough I already worked on Laravel and I can fulfill this task on Laravel as well but the only reason I chose Django not Laravel, is that at the moment I'm working for my final year project with BMW group I'm using Django. That is why I prefered to use the mentioned framework.
